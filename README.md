This is a simple game for begginers. There is a canvas and two balls: red and green. The player is the greenBall.
Using arrows you have to try to eat redBalls. every taken down redBall means increased speed of greenBall.
The main challenge of this game is that you have to stay in zone. 
crossing the border leads to lose. increased speed makes winning harder.![Screenshot (77)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77580098/216824599-d91e5eb8-1220-40be-905b-014d787cb528.png)
